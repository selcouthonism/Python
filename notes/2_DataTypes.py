'''
In other languages (java, C, C#), we define the data type and variable name. 
After that we cannot change the data type.
In java:
int number = 10;
float floatNumber = 10.5;
String text = "Hello World"; 
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

number = "Hello World"; -> Compiler error

Python has dynamic variable assignment.
We can assign an int,float, String... value to a variable 
and then can change its type by assigning new value with new data type.
In python:
number = 10  -> python defines number variable as int type
number = 10.8  -> python updates number variable as float type
number = "Hello World"  -> python updates number variable as String type
number = set() -> updates as empty set
